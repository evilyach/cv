% About me
I was born in Ryazan, Russia, and I have been passionate about information
technologies for most of my life.

Since school, I was always amazed at how complicated and chaotic, on one hand, and how beautiful and organized, on the other hand, the world around us is. It lead me to want to learn maths - the language of nature. This language got applied to physics, which to this day amazes me.

At some point, my vector of focus changed to information technologies. I started to learn how computers work, and I learn something every single day. I still apply this knowledge daily for creating better and more optimized software and for hacking the technology around me, for creating a better world to live in.
